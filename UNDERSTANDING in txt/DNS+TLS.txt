### DNS

- DNS: domain name system is the phonebook of the internet
- When we type in a website like github.com, the DNS connects to IP address
- Cache
    - Browser level cache
    - OS level cache
    - ISP(Internet service provider) level cache
    - Finally, if these do not have the address, DNS lookup checks for 
        - .com addresses
        - then github.com
- Techniques used to avoid DNS bottlenecks
    - Round Robin DNS
        - DNS returns multiple IP addresses for single website
    - Load balancers
        - Multiple servers histed by big websites to evenly distribute traffic
    - Geographic DNS
        - For people of a certain area are served with that area's severs

### socket opening + TLS

- First the broswer(client) sends an unencrypted message (ClientHello) to server which says which encryption methods and TLS version is there
- Then server sends (ServerHello) certificate containing server's public key + signed by Certificate Authority 
- Browser/client verifies the certificate
- Broswer genrates random bytes and locks it using the server's public keys, sends it to server. Only server can open this key because it has the private key
- Server decrypts message using its private key, uses same random  bytes to generate symmetric key. Both sides have same symmetric key
- client sends "finished" message, server then does the same

### HTTP protocol
